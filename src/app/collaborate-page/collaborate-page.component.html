        you need further assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:BCParksUserResearch@gov.bc.ca">

    <h3>Resolving and Actioning Issues</h3>
    <p>
        When actioning an issue, consider
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">
            linking your pull request
        </a>. This not only allows for collaborators to see who
        is working on what issues, but it also makes it so that the issue is automatically closed when the pull request
        is merged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, take some time to consider what kind of change you are making. Is it a
        <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/contribute#small-changes">small change</a>, or a
        <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/contribute#big-changes">big
            change</a>? This may determine how you resolve the issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Small Changes</h3>
    <p>
        If you are just making small changes to a few words in one file (likely a
        <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/ExchangeLabOps/contribute#a-note-on-markdown">Markdown</a> file), then it would
        be
        acceptable and easy to use the <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/editing-files-in-your-repository">GitHub
            file editor</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-playbook">bcgov repo</a>. This is not
        advisable for larger changes,
        or if you plan on making changes to multiple pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Big Changes</h3>
    <p>
        You will need a foundational understanding of Git and GitHub concepts, such as repos, commits, and
        <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull
            requests</a>, for submitting larger contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you submit a contribution for adding, changing, or removing content you will have to submit a pull request,
        which will be reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are making big structural or visual changes to the playbook, we suggest that you get set up for local
        development on your computer. This increases efficiency by allowing you to preview the changes you are making in
        real time, and it reduces the risk of pushing errors to production.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before proceeding read <a href="https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll/blob/main/README.md">this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Follow these steps when making big changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> of the
            <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-playbook">bcgov repo</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Enable <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub
                Pages</a> on the forked repo
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository">Clone</a>
            the fork to your local machine
        </li>
        <li>
            Issue the following commands to push the changes to your forked repo:
        </li>
        <pre><code>
                
            git add .
            git commit -m “Meaningful message about your changes” 
            git push origin master</code></pre> <!-- These tags are whitespace sensitive. -->
        <li>
            Ensure everything looks good on your forked GitHub Pages site
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Note: the way GitHub Pages compiles your website may differ than what you see during local
                    development.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull
                request</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Note on Versioning</h3>
    <p>
        If the changes you are making to the site are quite large, consider creating a new version release. Please
        consult these resources before creating a new version:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository">Version
                releases with GitHub</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://semver.org/">Version tagging concepts</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Note on Markdown</h3>
    <p>
        The Markdown files that hold the playbook content live in the “plays” and “pages” folders. If you are unfamiliar
        with Markdown,
        <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">this</a> is a good place to get started.
