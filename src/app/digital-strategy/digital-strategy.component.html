        <h1>Digital Strategy</h1>
        <p>
            BC Parks is setting out to be a model of modernization efforts underway across the BC Government, doing
            so in alignment with both local digital principles and global good practices for digital-era
            governments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Broadly, we’re undertaking this digital transformation in order to better fulfil our
            mandate for the province’s parks and protected areas. More specifically, in terms of our digital
            products and services, this means we’re committing to providing a simpler, more streamlined, open,
            consistent, data-driven and citizen-centered experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            While these efforts – like the definition of
            digital itself – extend far beyond technology alone, we’re establishing this site to be a hub of
            information and collaboration for technologists wishing to contribute to BC Parks’ change initiatives.
