        Mission
    </h2>
    <p>
        Our parks and protected areas are a public trust. As such, our mission is to protect representative and
        special natural places within the Province's protected areas system for world class conservation,
        outdoor
        recreation, education and scientific study.

        Working in the open
    </h2>
    <p>
        BC Parks aims to deliver digital products that meet people's needs, we work openly to share our work,
        engage
        with
        citizens and collaborate with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why we work this way... by demonstrating openness and transparency it helps to engage with citizens and
        the
        sectors
        we work with, and connects with others working in related fields across the world. As such it is vital
        for
        netowrk
        and alliance building. For the organisations we work within it provides a greater sense of authenticity.
